      <h2>8 to CREATE</h2>
      <h4>logo and postcard design</h4>
      <p>
        Logo design for 8 to CREATE, a Registered Student Organization at the
        University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 8 to CREATE is a collaborative
        art exhibit in which 8 artists each create a largescale piece of art
        during an 8 hour period.
        <br>
        <br>
        8 to CREATE’s mission is to present art, not only as a final product that
        is tangible, sold and bought; but also as a process, in which the journey
        of creation engages thought. In the 8 to CREATE exhibit, no artwork is
        sold, so there is no assigned value to the product. What remains in the
        artist and the public viewers is the memory and the experience of the
        process of creation.

        <h3>Logo Form</h3>
        <p>
          8 artists have 8 hours to create 8 drawing; the goal for this logo was to
          convey this slogan.
          <br><br>
          Credit goes to Karolina Malacynska for coming up with the idea to combine
          the “8” and hourglass. In order to minimize the complexity of this logo I
          used the negative space of the 8 to create an hourglass.

            We handed out these cards at Quad Day to advertise for 8 to CREATE and
